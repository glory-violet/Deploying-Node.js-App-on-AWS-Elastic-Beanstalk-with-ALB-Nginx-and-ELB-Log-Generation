# Node.js-App-Deployment-on-AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk-with-ALB-and-Nginx-Configuration
#### This GitHub repository hosts the source code and documentation for a project that guides you through setting up a Node.js application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Nginx. The project is divided into multiple phases, each covering a specific aspect of the setup.

## Project - List Of Applications Used:
#### 1. [Express.js] - A web application framework for Node.js used to build the simple "Hello World" application.
#### 2. [npm] (Node Package Manager) - Used for managing dependencies and initializing the project.
#### 3. [AWS] Management Console - Used for creating and managing resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
#### 4. [AWS Elastic Beanstalk] - A fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in multiple languages.
#### 5. [AWS EC2] (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Instances are used for deploying the Node.js application and configuring Nginx.
#### 6. [AWS Application Load Balancer] (ALB) - Used to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, ensuring the availability and fault tolerance of applications.
#### 7. [Nginx] - A web server and reverse proxy server used to forward requests to the Node.js application.
#### 8. [nano] (Text Editor) - A command-line text editor used for editing Nginx configuration files on the EC2 instance.
#### 9. AWS Elastic Beanstalk [Health Checks] - Configured to assess the health and status of the Node.js application on Elastic Beanstalk.
#### 10. AWS Elastic Beanstalk [Logs] - Ensure that logs are being generated as expected to facilitate troubleshooting and monitoring.
